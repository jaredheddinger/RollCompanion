iOS app for logging Dungeons &amp; Dragons gameplay/character sheet information.

## Character Creation
Currently, you can create any number of custom characters with assigned Name, Race, Class, Hit Point Max, and Ability scores. (Skill and Proficiency selection will be added)

## Detail Screens 
### Combat

The combat view shows all the necessary information for a combat situation - including hit points, armor class, and proficency bonus. Additional buttons allow the player to take or heal damage and add temporary hit points.

Modifiers are calculated automatically for the user below ability scores, and a weapons table for the user to add any weapons they might collect. 

### Roleplaying 

The roleplay view shows all the skill modifiers for the given character, in addition to a section for adding items - much like the weapon table. Like the ability modifiers, skill modifiers are calculated automatically according to ability dependency.
